# Object-Track
My project is determining the distance of Face from a camera on real time based , This is actually a very well studied problem in the computer vision/image processing space and  algorithm is designed to serve the position identification of object for the robots and other systems 
This work is based on detecting the distance and position both at a real time by using python and opencv modules. 
The identify Face position of the detected face if it is in the right, the left or the middle of the screen is displayed with distance range and position name like front or down right 
Anonymous Face Tracking can be used by retailers to count the number of visitors and to track the movement of visitors through their stores. This data can then be used to optimize store layout, staffing, and restocking of shelves.

Digital signage providers can also use anonymous face tracking to determine how many people are viewing their displays, what their demographics are, and how much time people spend looking at their displays. This data can then be used by advertisers to optimize their campaigns.
